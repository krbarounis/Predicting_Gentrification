# Predicting_Gentrification

This project aims to explore trends in the Boston area using 2000 and 2010 census data and ultimately predict which census tracts will be considered gentrifying by the 2020 census.

I've created a dashboard that reflects trends discovered during the EDA process as well as the gentrified neighborhoods in Boston discovered through use of clustering algorithms. Take a look! https://kristinab-dash-app.herokuapp.com/
